# Haskell

Haskell is a lazy, functional, maths-hipster language created by drunk
scotsmen who clearly had some sort of genius-epiphany and created a
work of art.

Haskell is reallly strict, and sometimes feels like you're tied up
by a mad conrtol freak. That pays off though, when all your code
doesn't segfault all the time and stuff.
