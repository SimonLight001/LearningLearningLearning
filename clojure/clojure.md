# Clojure

Clojure is a lisp language that runs on the JVM (Java Virtual Machine). It is a primarily functional language that can interop with Java, Scala, Groovy, and any other JVM langauge.

Clojure also has ClojureScript, a clojuer compiler which compiles to Javascript, allowing for front-end work to be done with it.
