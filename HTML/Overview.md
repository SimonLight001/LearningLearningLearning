HTML
====
HTML is short hand for Hyper Text Mark-up Language.
HTML is pretty much only used for web pages.
HTML on it's own is very ugly, however, by learning a few other languages can make it look and do some very nice things.
Common languages that work with HTML are:
Front end languages:
-CSS
-JavaScript
Back end languages:
-PHP
-ASP.Net
-Ruby
-Node/JavaScript

HTML is based upon XML and so is written with angled brackets.
HTML s written by surrounding text in these brackets like so:
	<p>Hello World<p>
