# C

C is one of the earliest programming languages, created by Dennis Ritchie
(may his soul rest eternal in computer science heaven) for use in UNIX.

It has manual memory management, ridiculous speed, and makes it really
easy to shoot yourself in the foot with. If it was a gun, the barrel would
curl down towards your toes.

C is like, the only language used for embedded programming, with the occasional
exception of C++ and sometimes python. Almost all Operating Systems are written
in C.
